The HustleGPT Challenge is primarily about building a business with the help of ChatGPT or GPT-4. Some folks are letting HustleGPT take the wheel and make all of the executive decisions while others or treating Hustle GPT as a co-founder with which they can discuss business decisions. Regardless of which route you take, its important to be aware up front that this is still a lot of work! 

Below is a collection of resources that can help you build a business with HustleGPT. Feel free to add more with a pull request!
